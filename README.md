# Desloader

## How To use
> [!NOTE]
> There is no official release of DesLoader at the moment.

DesLoader Adds all types of tools to load things into Desmos. DesLoader is to be used mainly with Desmos 3D.

> [!WARNING]
> DESLOADER NEEDS TO BE USED WITH [DESMODDER](https://github.com/DesModder/DesModder)

Once you have installed DesLoader and DesModder you might see a button in the Top left of your screen that says "Show". This is how you will access the DesLoader menu. Once open you will see a large menu fill the screen That says tools.

### Tools

This Bit will go in order of what is show in the menu from top down.

#### Hide
This allows you to hide the menu at any time.

#### Save State
This allows you to save the current state of the calculator into a .des file for sharing files over the 5MB cap.

#### Load State
This allows you to Load any valid .des file into the calculator.

#### Color
This allows you to select the color you want you imported 3D file to be by letting you tell it what color variable to use.

#### Load OBJ
This allows you to load any OBJ file into Desmos no matter the tri count.

#### Load OBJ Optimized
This allows you to load OBJ files into Desmos as long as there is less than 10,000 triangles in the model. There is some Settings to this one as well.

#### Load OBJ Optimized Settings

"Load OBJ Optimized with array for Placement" Allows you to input an array name into the "Array Name For Placement" text box and the length of the array into the "Array Count" text box to make a large number of the model at the offset location's with high performance.
"Load OBJ Optimized with array for Rotations" Does the same thing as "Load OBJ Optimized with array for Placement" but for rotating the objects and not offsetting them.

#### Load Array from CSV

This allows you to load a position or rotation array from a CSV file.

## Tips

- You can use both "Load OBJ Optimized with array for Placement" and "Load OBJ Optimized with array for Rotations" at the same time.
- There will be examples and a training graph to mess around with.
